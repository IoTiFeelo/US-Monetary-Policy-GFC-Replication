    "section": "Global Factor in Risky Asset Prices",
    "text": "Global Factor in Risky Asset Prices\nMiranda-Agrippino and Rey in the first part of the paper estimate a global factor to proxy the movement of world risky asset prices. They do so by collecting 858 prices of different risky assets traded in North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific, and Australia, from 1990 to 2012. Their method is to pick a representative market index (i.e. S&P 500) for each market at the end of 2012, including all of its components, selecting prices that allow them to cover at least 80% of cross sectional observations by 1990 and 95% in 1995. They do so to avoid over-representation of each category. With this global factor, they can explain over 20% of global risky asset price volatility in their time span. Given the small time frame and VAR analysis limitations, they estimate a global factor with commodities from the U.S., Europe, and Japan, spanning back to 1975. This factor covers 60% of the volatility in this period. The appendix of the paper provides detailed information on this VAR estimation. To provide more intuition on this factor, the authors correlate it with some indexes of implied volatility such as the VIX, outlining its co-movement with common measures of market variation (in this case a negative correlation). The global factor will be used later in the impulse-response section."

    "text": "Proxy-VAR Analysis with Rich-Information Bayesian VAR\nIn this project, I will avoid the computation of the global factor, because it is out of scope of the Macroeconomerics subject. Instead, I will concentrate on the Bayesian VAR analysis of Miranda-Agrippino and Rey. A main reason why the authors studied the monetary effects of U.S. interest rate changes is that the dollar is the currency of global banking. A change in FED monetary policy affects banks’ borrowing capacity, the pricing of dollar denominated assets, and cross-border capital flows. In order to isolate its effects, the two scholars identify U.S. monetary policy shocks by exploiting 30-min price revisions around Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) announcements in the fourth federal funds futures contracts (FF4). The intuition is that these futures have an average maturity of three months, and they can predict revisions of market expectations about future monetary policy one-quarter in advance. This assumption holds only if market participants can distinguish between the systematic component of policy and any observable policy action. Moreover, with asymmetrical information, the FF4 revisions contain information about the influence of economic factors relevant to U.S. monetary policy. Policy announcements provide this information implicitly."
